# Step 3: Create a Visualizer

Go to the &#39;Visualizers&#39; tab of the Content Library and click on &#39;Create Visualizer&#39; and choose &#39;New Visualizer&#39;.   You&#39;ll be creating a new empty visualizer instead of importing one (hence the warning to sharpen the Html pencil).

Use the title field at the top to call it &#39;CTA Slider Visualizer&#39;, and choose the Content Type of &#39;CTA Slider&#39; at the bottom.  Give it a nice description that will make sense to you in 6 months time when someone starts asking awkward questions.

Totally ignore the &#39;Editor&#39; part of things and Save the visualizer.  You&#39;re about to see what it looks like without any Html, CSS or script code.

To do that, you&#39;ll need to add it to a page.
