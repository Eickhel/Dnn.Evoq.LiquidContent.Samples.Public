# Step 8 : Edit your Content Item to add the extra Slider image

Click on &#39;Content&#39; in your Content Library and open up the Content item.  You&#39;ll now see there are new fields for Slide 2 image, title, link and description, Slide 3 and Slide 4.  Pick the images and add the text fields for each of the values.
