This part is easy.   Put your site into edit mode by clicking on the Edit pencil in the lower left, then click on &#39;Add Module&#39;

This will open up the Add Module window and you can select &#39;Visualizer&#39; from the &#39;Recommended&#39; section.

This is going to give you a list of Visualizer Types to choose from â€“ pick the &#39;Content Item&#39; type:

Once the Content Item type is chosen, you&#39;ll see the &#39;CTA Slider&#39; Content Type at the top of the list.

Select that and you&#39;ll see your &#39;CTA Slider Visualizer&#39; to choose.  Select that and you&#39;ll see the list of eligible Content Items.  Because you&#39;ve only created one (so far)

Select that one and click &#39;Apply&#39; and you&#39;ll finally get to see your Content Item, displaying in your Visualizer:

But it looks terrible!   Just a jumble of image and words!   Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll fix that by actually giving the visualizer some style.
