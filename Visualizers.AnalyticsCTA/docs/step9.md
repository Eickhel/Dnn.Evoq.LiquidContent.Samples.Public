# Step 9 : Add in CTA Link Definitions to Content Type

The CTA Links include the text of the link and the link itself, which is where the visitor will go when they click it.  This demo will keep it simple, but the link is up to you.

What is required is some extra data in the Content Type.  The extra data required is what text is going to be used for the Call to Action (classic : &#39;Buy Now&#39;), and what the CTA link will be.

Open and edit the Content Type  for the CTA Slider and add Single Line Text fields for Slide 1 CTA Link and Slide 1 CTA Link Text.   Then repeat that for Slide 2 CTA Link and Slide 2 CTA Link Text, then Slide 3 and Slide 4 with the same 2 fields.

Save and Close the CTA Slider Content Type.   Any new Content Type fields then need to be shown in the Visualizer â€“ the next step is obvious (by now).
