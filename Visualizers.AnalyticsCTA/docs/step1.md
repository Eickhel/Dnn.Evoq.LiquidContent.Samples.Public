# Step 1 : Create a New Content type

Liquid Content starts with Content Types.  We&#39;ll create a specific Content Type for holding a set of Content designed for your Carousel (or Slider, as the example shows).

Create a new Content Type called &#39;CTA Slider&#39; by going to Mange-&gt;Content Library-&gt;Content Types, New Content Type.

Add the following fields to the Content Type:

Title : single line text

Slide 1 Image : Asset -&gt; Image

Slide 1 Title : single line text

Slide 1 Link Text : single line text

Slide 1 Description : multi line text

You can arrange the fields in any way you like to make it look simple and easy to fill out.

Click &#39;Save and Close&#39; when you&#39;re finished.  The Content Type is ready to try out.
