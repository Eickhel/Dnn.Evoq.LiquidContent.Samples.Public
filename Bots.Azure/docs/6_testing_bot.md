# Test your Recipes bot

## Test your bot locally

Now that you have all the code, start the command prompt **debughost.cmd** and target your Bot Emulator to your local endpoint, or if you prefer to debug, open Visual Studio and run the Task Runner Explorer as shown in the &quot;Debug in your local environment&quot; section.

**IMPORTANT: Once you are done, don&#39;t forget to commit the changes in your repository to allow the source control integration to publish your bot automatically on Azure.**
