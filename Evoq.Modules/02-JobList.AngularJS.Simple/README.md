# Evoq Modules - Liquid Content Job List
 
This is a sample DNN module to access Liquid Content using Angular JS v1.6. A bearer token with read permission for Liquid Content is generated on the server side and passed to the front-end.

## View.ascx
 
Add a div with Angular controller using "ng-controller" directive (line #3 in the code in the following screenshot). ScopeWrapper.ClientId is a unique id generated by dnn on the server side. Use it to give unique name to the controller.  
Add a div with unique id using ScopeWrapper.ClientId (line #4). It will be a container for Angular application.

To keep array of Module IDs use dnn.moduleIds global variable. Angular application will need the ids to know in what container to bootstrap.
Also there is a dnn.app variable that bundle Angular app to unique controller

Configure webpack to load bundle in the path that is used in View.ascx

ng-repeat directive iterates through each job in JobList and repeats the job-item element for each iteration
 
## app.js
 
Get moduleId first. It will be used to name Angular module and Angular controller to make it unique for each Evoq module

Create an empty object as a global variable. In this variable we will store Angular modules and controllers for each Evoq module
 
![Screenshot8](images/screenshot8.png)
 
Create an Angular module using moduleId. One Angular module per Evoq module. Bind template and controller to it.

Create an Angular controller using moduleId. The controller is a JS class. Provide $scope, $htpp, $compile and $sce services to the constructor of the class.

Inject all the services into the controller.

Inside of the constructor of the controller Append template app.html to the Evoq module DOM. Compile the template using $compile service.

Liquid Content requires a bearer token for a client to access the APIs. Get the token from DOM element of the Evoq Module.

Get the Id of the "Job Posting" content type. We need this id to get content items only of the "Job Posting" content type.
Asynchronously call loadPage() function after getting the content type id.

Load content items using content type id. Store the result into the $scope.

Register the Angular module with the controller.

To be able to load multiple Angular modules on the same page, bootstrap all the modules. Bootstrap should happen only once for all modules. There is a delay with timeout that alows the next module to clear the timeout. This way only when the last module is loaded bootstrap will execute.
